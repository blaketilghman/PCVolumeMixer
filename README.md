# PCVolumeMixer

This was a very rough Proof of Concept I made back in 2018 and recently came across the code for. It is a volume mixer for Windows that lets you control the volume of individual applications on a PC.

It uses an Arduino Pro Micro, a custom PCB, and four potentiometers.
The pots are connected to A0-A3 on the Pro Micro.

Included are the 3D model files that I made for the case, the gerber files for the PCB, and all the code that I could find.
